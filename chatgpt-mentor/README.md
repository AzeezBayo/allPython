# ChatGPT: Your Personal Python Coding Mentor

This repository holds the code used in the Real Python [ChatGPT: Your Personal Python Coding Mentor](https://realpython.com/chatgpt-coding-mentor-python/) tutorial, along with a few additional files.

## Run the Scripts

All example scripts should run on any Python version >=3.6 by executing the files with the interpreter:

```console
$ python filename.py
```

To play with the different implementations of FizzBuzz, you can load the files interactively into a REPL using the `-i` flag.

## Prompts

The repository also contains an additional file called [prompts.md](prompts.md) that lists all the prompts used in the tutorial. If you want to try them in your own ChatGPT conversations, then you can copy the prompts from that file.
